# Using LaTeX to typeset your written documents

## TLDR

The aim of this page is to give a super simple quick start for using LaTeX to typeset your documents.

## What is...?

LaTeX is a set of tools for turning marked up text into beautiful documents.

## Why?

Word (& word processors in general) are pretty bad for any substantial piece of writing. LaTeX is one alternative that you should consider. However, like most general and powerful tools, it requires a bit of knowledge to help you get started.


## Useful Links

- My [Quick Start](https://github.com/siwells/latex-enu-quickstart) document that I give to students to get "up and running". This has just enough to get started.
- [LaTeX Advice](https://github.com/dspinellis/latex-advice) - A page that collects a bunch of really useful, occasionally opinionated, advice.
