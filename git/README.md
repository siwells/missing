# Using Git to store your source code (& other plain text resources)

## TLDR

The aim of this page is to give a super simple introduction to Git

## What is...?

Git is a set of tools for managing plain text resources, such as source code, which helps you to manage the integrity of and changes within your files. It's most frequently associated with computer source code, but is great for anything that is plain text, like configuration files, or LaTex source files. It's great for collaborating within teams, but also for individual use, and supports lots of different workflows. There is a caveat though, like all powerful tools, it can take a while to get to grips with (and there is a lot to learn).
