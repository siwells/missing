# Recording a screencast 

## TLDR

The aim of this page is to give a super simple quick-start for recording screencasts of your work.

## What is....?

A screencast is simply a video recording of your screen as you interact with your software. This may, or may not, depending upon the situation, include a voice-over of you describing what you are doing. 

## Making a screencast: Software

Screencasts are straightforward to record on most major platforms. This guide will prioritise free solutions that are built-in to platforms, followed by free, installable options. There are also commerical solutions but that will remain outside of the remit of this guide.


### Platform Specific Solutions

Each of the following is fine for recording a simple screencast:

* Windows 10 includes the game DVR feature.
* Mac OS enables screen-recording via the QuickTime Player application. 

### Cross-platform solutions

* Open Broadcaster Software ([OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/).
