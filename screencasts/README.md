# Recording a screencast 

## TLDR

The aim of this page is to give a super simple quick-start for recording screencasts of your work.

## What is....?

A screencast is simply a video recording of your screen as you interact with your software. This may, or may not, depending upon the situation, include a voice-over of you describing what you are doing. 

## Making a screencast: Software

Screencasts are straightforward to record on most major platforms. This guide will prioritise free solutions that are built-in to platforms, followed by free, installable options. There are also commerical solutions but that will remain outside of the remit of this guide.


### Platform Default Solutions

Each of the following is fine for recording a simple screencast:

* Windows 10 includes the game DVR feature. You can use the "Win+G" shortcut to access the game bar and "Win+alt+R" to start/stop recording.
* Mac OS enables screen-recording via the QuickTime Player application. Access the feature either by launching Quicktime or by using the "Cmd+Shift+5" shortcut.
* Linux - there is sufficient range of Linux distribution but such ease of software installation and management that we refer you to the list of installable solutions below.

### Installable solutions

* Open Broadcaster Software ([OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)) - This runs on Linux, macOS and Windows and is your one stop shop for pretty much all your video/screen recording and live streaming needs.
* SimpleScreenRecorder ([https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/](https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/)) - On the linked page scroll down to the download section and use the package management invokation for your platform, e.g. $ sudo apt-get install simplescreenrecorder if you're on Debian or Ubuntu.
* Microsoft PowerPoint - If you have this installed then recent version include a screen-recording feature. See this Twitter [post/video](https://twitter.com/MicrosoftEDU/status/1253778753530089472) for more information. Ostensibly this is to enable you to record videos for embedding directly into a presentation but also includes facilities to enable you to export your screencast in various formats.
