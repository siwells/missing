# The Missing Module

All the things that you should know about computers but that don't get included of fit neatly into the average software engineering or CompSci curriculum...

The eventual aim is to create a resource for learning all those soft skills and filling in the gaps between the things that you are formally taught and those things you are just expected to pick up and learn on account of your great interest in computers and general geekery. This resource will, in the long term, include a crashcourse to get you up and running on a variety of topics such as (re-)installing an OS, creating and using a VM, setting up a web-server, learning interesting but "non-standard" languages, using VIm, using Emacs, using LaTeX, using Git, &c.

For the moment though, we need to work out what topics to include. The best place to start that process is using GitHub issues. So check the [current issues](https://github.com/siwells/missing/issues) (and comment on any if neccessary). If the thing you want to learn isn't listed, then log in and add a new issue. As time allows, I'll then address suggested topics. I'll also accept pull requests from anyone who wants to contribute bug-fixes and high-quality contributions so feel free to join in.
